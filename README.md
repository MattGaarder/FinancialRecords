# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview
 
In this challenge I analysed the financial records of a fictional company and retreived things such as the total number of months being analysed, the average change in profits over said period, and the greatest losses and profits. 

This was achieved using iterative for loops, and storing values in variables to compare any larger or smaller results in the finance records. 

I also learned how to use the document.getElementById to show the desired results on an HTML page. This was most certainly super challenging, but I am really pleased with the results!
